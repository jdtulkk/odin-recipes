                seasoning. Form mixture into tot-shaped cylinders.</p></li>

                a single row without touching each other or the sides of the basket. Spray tots
                with olive oil spray and sprinkle with sea salt.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and cook tots for 8 minutes.
